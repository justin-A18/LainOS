				<b class='text-[#BB667B]'>LainOS</b> began as a <b>passion project</b> inspired
				by the cult anime
				<b>Serial Experiments Lain</b> (1998). The show's depiction of a futuristic
				interface — the mythical <b>CoplandOS</b> — resonated deeply with tech-savvy
				fans. The design, cryptic and layered, was reminiscent of Apple’s abandoned
				Copland project yet carried an almost <b>sentient aesthetic</b>,
				inspiring a generation of developers to recreate it in reality.
			</p>

			<p class='max-w-3xl leading-relaxed text-gray-300 text-lg'>
				The first attempt appeared in the <b>early 2000s</b>, pitched as a
				modification of
				<b>FreeBSD 4.5</b>. The goal: merge <i>alien elegance</i> with practicality,
				featuring animated splash screens and a custom interface. Despite ambitious
				beginnings, development stalled by 2005. Hosted at <b
					>lainos.sourceforge.net</b
				>, it reached an unstable alpha stage before being abandoned — leaving
				behind concepts but no functional system.
			</p>

			<p class='max-w-3xl leading-relaxed text-gray-300 text-lg'>
				In <b>March 2022</b>, <b class='text-[#BB667B]'
					>Grayson “amnesia1337” Giles</b
				> reached out to the original <b>lainos.org</b> maintainer, <b
					>Kenshinfo</b
				>, to revive the project. A
				<b>Matrix room</b> was created and remains active to this day. With Kenshinfo
				absent as of mid-2023, Grayson took leadership, steering LainOS toward a
				modern, functional vision. The first alpha release — based on <b
					>MX Linux</b
				> — received strong community feedback, motivating the migration to <b
					>Arch Linux</b
				> for its flexibility and rolling-release model.
			</p>

			<p class='max-w-3xl leading-relaxed text-gray-300 text-lg'>
				The current iteration, <b>LainOS Arch Edition</b>, features <b
					>Hyprland</b
				> and
				<b>Openbox</b> environments designed to replicate the series’ eerie minimalism:
				overlapping windows, dark tones, and a clean yet unsettling aesthetic. It
				includes privacy-focused tools like <b>KeepassXC</b>, <b>GPA</b>, <b
					>macchanger</b
				>,
				<b>Kloak</b>, <b>WireGuard</b>, <b>Proxychains-ng</b>, <b>Tor</b>, and <b
					>I2P</b
				> — all reinforcing the show’s core themes of <b
					>identity, anonymity, and the Wired</b
				>.
			</p>

			<p class='max-w-3xl leading-relaxed text-gray-300 text-lg'>
				Today, LainOS stands as a <b>niche labor of love</b> — an OS made by fans
				for fans. It’s not meant to dominate the desktop world, but to <b
					>embody the spirit of experimentation</b
				>
				and pay homage to Lain’s digital philosophy. The roadmap includes <b
					>community feedback loops</b
				>, bug fixes, and even an <b>Artix-based</b> version without systemd — a
				nod to the project’s minimalist roots.
			</p>

			<p class='text-gray-400 mt-10 italic text-sm'>
				"LainOS isn’t just an operating system — it’s a manifestation of an
				idea. A shared experiment between code and consciousness. The Wired is
				real. Connect responsibly."
